# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a tool, process and philosophy to facilitate crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development, testing, maintenance and support, to a level where it becomes the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. It may be useful for any collaborative initiative beyond software development. It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based enconomy to one where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn. For more information please visit the project wiki page at:

# Who is using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool and the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Features
 The tool, process and philosophy aim to provide the following features (please see the project wiki page for a more detailed overview of the features):
- Define a universal, accurate and indisputable measure of intellectual work. This will form the sole basis for determining the earnings of the crowd member. People can earn as much (or as less) as they deserve, based solely on their true intellectual effort.
- Increased security of the intellectual property of the project.
- Maximally reduced complexity of work. This in turn will allow more opportunties for people to make a living, contribute meaningfully and be financially successful.
- Allow people to be simultaneously associated with multiple projects and organizations, without the risks of traditional freelancing.
- The tool can be used for software testing, maintenance and support as well.
- Benefits for project customers:
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Sounds too good to be true! How is it possible?
The tool, process and philosophy definitively address issues related to 3 core limitations of the traditional job-based economy, in novel ways that we are not aware are known or used elsewhere:
- intellectual work measurement, especially software work measurement
- intellectual property security, especially when a project team consists of a large number of people
- skill levels needed for work that is traditionally outsourced to a team of people
Solving these limitations will allow organizations/projects to not have to rely on traditional methods of appraising people and keeping an eye on them in an 'office' location.

# Where do I begin to learn?
You are encouraged to start playing around with the tool and also simultaneously read up on the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. Once the tool, process and philosophy are fully stabilized, understood and popularized, existing large IT organizations or a community of people working part-time can start experiments with the process and the tool, in order to validate its expected benefits.

# How to use the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
3. To read the details of the process please visit the online documentation of this project at https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki
4. To use the tool, just download a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
