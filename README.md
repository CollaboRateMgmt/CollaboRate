# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a tool and a process to facilitate crowdsourcing of software development to a level where it becomes the most common way of software development. It holds the promise of allowing the maximum number of people possible, to simultaneously work on the same project. People can collaborate with each other in a for-profit, closed-source model that protects the intellectual property of the crowd as a whole. At the same time, it allows people to rate each other's contributions in an accurate and indisputable way. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.

# How to use it?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting.
