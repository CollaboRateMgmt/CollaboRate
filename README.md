# Purpose
CollaboRate is a process and a very simple software tool. It will transform the commercial IT industry! It enables effective crowdsourcing of commercial (closed-source) software development, [testing, maintenance and support](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Mapping-Software-Testing,-Maintenance-and-Customer-Support-to-Software-Development). It is the best project management process, model and technology known so far. It will bring vast benefits to customers, organizations and employees alike. It will boost global economic and technology progress. 

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project at the same time".  

When this happens, the time taken for project completion reduces.
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  
So the chance of project success increases.  

More people can take part in important projects than ever before. Do not worry if an important project gets over soon and you need to share the reward for the work done among many. Because, there is enough work in the world. Neither does this process mandate royalty to the crowd members for the work they do.

Estimations from the individual contributors are an overhead and a speculative activity. They lead to friction and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion time, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, we end the need for estimates from crowd members. 

Due to the new process, crowd members can measure each others' contributions exactly. The organization is also able to measure the project's exact 'intellectual effort size'. The customer pays based on this size.  

So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all:  
customer, organization and the crowd.

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. It will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

You may use this process for open source development as well. Open Source collaborators could work together better with this process. They may even wish to earn via this process. You can use this process with other open source business models. The open-source bounty model is one such promising business model.

It may be useful for any collaborative project outside IT, that involves only desk work. You may apply it to overcome the  general limitations of the desk-job-based economy. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# Detailed benefits for employees and their organizations
- Complete priority projects in record timeframes using huge crowds of people. Never miss a customer deadline again!
- Variable income in accurate proportion to contributions of the employee.   
- No need for subjective appraisals done by humans. This ends a huge source of overhead, stress, conflict and injustice.  
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues:
  - No need to call employees to an office and keep an eye on them. So employees can work from home.
  - Employees can work for many projects and organizations at the same time. Organizations will not have security or productivity concerns.

# Detailed benefits for customers
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# The Process, and how it works
The process solves 5 pain areas of desk-job industries especially IT, in novel ways:  
1. **Sharing work among many**. The process is the best because it exploits the principle 'many hands make light work'. The crowd themselves break down the project work, such that you can use the most number of crowd members.  A [project governing body](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Project-Governing-Body) consists of one or more SPOCs ((Single Point of Contact)s). This arrangement solves the resulting issue 'too many cooks spoil the broth'. Yet, efforts needed from the project governing body are very small. The crowd does the most work possible, including [work breakdown review](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process). The governing body does activities best done by 
ed single point of contacts. The governing body forms the core part of the organization or 'crowdsourcing vendor'.
2. **Work Measurement.** It defines a general-purpose and accurate measure of the smallest possible intellectual effort. We call this the microtask. Work measurement is very important for fairness and trust among all. You reward workers based on number of  microtasks, multiplied by money per microtask. You charge the customer based on the number of microtasks in the project.  
The project requirements form problem statements. A problem statement is less than (say) 300 words of standard business English. We define a microtask as the breakdown of a problem statement into 2 independent ones. By 'independent' we mean that the child problems refer neither to the parent nor to each other.  
The CollaboRate tool helps to perform the microtask (work breakdown). A simple copy-paste feature eases creation of child problem statements. We will soon provide more advanced features to check the child problem statements.
Requirement problem statements break down into 'logic problem' statements. The Collaborate tool helps to break down logic problem statements. To do this, it asks the user a couple of simple questions. When you break down logic problems, you also generate software program steps (pseudocode). So crowd members with no programming  background break down problems into code!  
You manage microtasks via any conventional bug tracking system. There are several available: Trac, Redmine, Bugzilla and so on. As you may know, you can use such systems to manage requirements (problem statements) as well.  
   
   The reward for crowd members is based purely on the number of microtasks done multiplied by a publicly known amount of money per microtask. However *in case* rewards are based on royalty, the trust factor becomes important:
   - The vendor must provide transparency on the total number of microtasks and who did how many.
   - Crowd members might suspect that fake microtasks exist to change royalty percentages. Crowdsourcing vendors must define a way to resolve this suspicion. Vendors need to balance information disclosure with intellectual property security. Vendors can provide limited information about the summary of the problem statements. Or, vendors can provide full information to an investigative third party. At present we descope detailed process specifications for this scenario.   
    
3. The process reduces the risks of incorrect or  incomplete work for the customer. It does so by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Most people will still continue to earn well. So they will agree to the [risk sharing process](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process).  *
4. The following allows for more inclusive participation and reduces project risk:  Risk 
  Sharing.**  - The crowd member does not need to know the entire project  requirement. As mentioned above, each problem statement to must be independent. You do not need to look up any  other documentation to understand it.
   - The crowd member does not need to know the codebase. The crowd member does not even have to know programming! Crowd members submit pseudo-code under guidance of the CollaboRate tool. The SPOCs convert the pseudo-code to the actual lines of code. They  decide whether the function described by the crowd member is a new or existing function. An existing function could be part of the codebase under development. Or it could be a 'ready-made' function that is part of the programming language. Or a reusable software library may already have it. The knowledgeable SPOCs handle this limited analysis and recollection from memory. 
   - Since the crowd works one microtask at a time, the work per crowd member is as small and easy as possible.  
   
   The process expects only the following skills from the crowd members:  
     - Enough knowledge of business English
     - Enough analytical capabilities 
     - Able to use the Internet to search for information
     - Willing to learn domain concepts referenced in the problem statement. You only need to learn to the extent needed to break down the problem into two sub-problems.

5. It ensures superior intellectual property security. Security increases with crowd size! The SPOCs will not share the codebase with the crowd members. A crowd member once assigned a task cannot refuse it. Otherwise, the financial penalties for an incomplete task apply. The tool's instructions warn crowd members to keep task details to themselves. The task tracking system will be configured so that only the needed crowd members can see a particular task. Since the project is split into a very large number of micro-tasks and each crowd member sees only a tiny part of the design/pseudo-code, you get intellectual property security.   

# Challenges foreseen in adopting this process
- Developers who are used to writing hundreds of lines of code per day, may find the process overhead unbearable for a while. However they need to keep in mind that it is a worthwhile temporary sacrifice in order to:
  - speed up work that is important to the world
  - increase employment opportunities for the masses
  - ensure that work is fairly measured    
- People must try to visualize that given this process and a long enough trial period, a large enough team that has no shortage of work will be faster and more productive than the old way of working.
- The process abstracts out technology and even simplifies algorithm thinking. People who want to learn a software technology in-depth should use this process for earning only. For learning software technologies, they can work on open source projects that do not use this process, or they can study the source code of open source projects.

# Who's using it?
As of now the project has just released its first version.

# How to use the tool?
[Download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step  needed. Open CollaboRate.html in your web browser. I recommend FireFox. Answer the questions and follow the instructions shown by the wizard.

# Why the name 'CollaboRate' ?
This process and tool allows the most number of people possible, to work on the same project at the same time. It allows people to work over the internet with each other. It does so by ending complexity and security concerns. So it maximizes the power of collaboration. It also allows people to *rate* (appraise) each others' contributions. The rating is accurate, fair and transparent. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.

# Contributing
We need to understand, debate, test and stabilize the process and tool. We also need experiments to confirm the process and tool. We need to add more automation to the defined process. We need to add more intelligence to the tool and allow it to plug into issue/defect tracking systems. Volunteers may contact me at sohrabsaran@gmail.com.

# Acknowledgements
- Though I had various ideas for collaboration tools starting from around 2004, I was introduced last year to the term 'Crowdsourcing' and attempts to commercialize it, by my present employer. Any colleagues who discussed and participated in experiments cannot be acknowledged (see disclaimer) but are welcome to contribute to this project now that it is hosted on Github.
- Wikipedia article on Crowdsourcing introduced me to the term 'microtask'.
- An internet search showed me that at least 2 organizations (University of California Irvine and Microsoft Research) are exploring the feasibility of software microtasks. This increased my confidence in the feasibility of such an idea.
