# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a set of philosophies, processes and a very simple software tool, that will radically transform the commercial IT industry and probably also other intellectual-property intensive industries. This project enables effective crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development, testing, maintenance and support. This is the best project management model and technology known so far, bringing major benefits to customers, organizations and employees alike. 

Here crowdsourcing means having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project.  
So the time taken for project completion greatly reduced.
So the need for estimation of project end date is greatly reduced.
In particular, the need for estimates to be provided by crowd members, is eliminated.
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project, which is very easy.  
So the chance of project success is greatly increased.  
Last but not least, crowd members are able to easily able to measure what they and others have contributed to the project, in an almost indisputable way.
All this results in greatly increased and inclusive earning potential for crowd members, who are mostly ordinary IT workers such as you and I!

The process and tool systematically solve the problems seen when we have a very large number of people working on the same project. It will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry, due to the benefits that it will provide customers, organizations and IT workers alike. The most interesting benefits would be for IT workers who will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. Developers could earn via this model, perhaps in conjunction with other open source business models such as open-source bounty.

It may be useful for any collaborative intellectual endeavor outside software development.  It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based economy, to give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# How it works

This project comprehensively addresses 5 pain areas of the traditional intellectual-property-based and job-based economy, in novel ways that (as far as we are aware) are not known or used elsewhere:
1. It defines a general-purpose, highly accurate and transparent measure of intellectual effort, that is very important to ensure fairness and trust amongst all the project members and the customer. This is used in place of estimations as the measure by which to reward crowd members and size the project.
2. It ensures that the risks of incorrect or incomplete work are reduced, by fairly and sustainably sharing the risk with the crowd.
3. It ensures that technical, codebase and requirements knowledge needed to participate in the project are negligible, thus allowing more inclusive participation by the crowd and in turn reducing the project's complexity risk.
4. It defines a way for a large number of people to smoothly participate in the same project, with minimal efforts needed from the project governing body.  
5. It ensures superior intellectual property security, that in an apparent paradox, actually increases with crowd size!

#Detailed benefits for employees and their organizations
- Variable wage-based income accurately proportional to net positive intellectual effort of the employee. 
  - No need for subjective appraisals done by humans
  - Crowd members will earn fairly based on their net positive intellectual effort
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues, no need to call employees to an office and keep an eye on them. So employees can work from home.
- Employees can work for multiple projects and organizations at the same time.

# Detailed benefits for customers
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Who's using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool, as well as the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Getting started
First please read the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki).

# How to use the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting. Though the tool attempts to provide instructions about the process to follow, it is probably better to go through the documentation first (that covers the philosophy and the overall process). This will help to better understand where and why the tool is used in the overall recommended process.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
3. To use the tool, just [download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
