# Purpose
CollaboRate is a process and a simple software tool. It will transform the commercial IT industry! It enables effective crowdsourcing of commercial (closed-source) software development, [testing, maintenance and support](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Mapping-Software-Testing,-Maintenance-and-Customer-Support-to-Software-Development). It is the best project management process, model and technology known so far. It will benefit customers of IT services, IT organizations and employees alike. It may transform the way we do all desk jobs. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project at the same time".  

When this happens, the time taken for project completion reduces.  

Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  

So the chance of project success increases!  

More people can take part than ever before, in projects that are important to the world. Even an average person can now contribute. 

Do not worry if an important project gets over soon. It is ok to have a project done by many, and so have tiny rewards per worker per project. Because, there is enough work in the world. 

This process specifies that you reward crowd members for their actual mental effort. As an extra, you may choose to have royalty-based rewards for the crowd members. 

In the new process, you measure mental contributions exactly. You also measure the project's exact 'mental effort size'. The customer pays based on this size. 
So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all:  
customer, organization and the crowd.

Estimates from individual contributors are overheads and speculation. They lead to overhead, friction, stress, overwork and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, crowd members need not provide estimates. The customer of the IT service company does rough estimation of time and project size. We define a core part of the organization as the 'crowdsourcing vendor'. This group can also share estimation responsibility. 

  The estimated size of the project must not exceed its budget. That is the only reason that remains for estimates. Estimates are no longer needed for project duration and costing. 

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. It will be the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

You may use this process for open source development as well. Open Source collaborators could work together better with this process. As we said earlier, now a huge number of people can work at the same time, on a project that is important to the world.  Open source projects are all very important to the world. 

Open source business models can use this process. Also, we hope that duplicate effort among open source projects is minimal. So people can do unique work that is important to the world, and earn at the same time.  

The [open-source bounty model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty) is the best open source business model. It allows crowdfunding of significant rewards from an unlimited number of requestors. The requests are to fix or enhance open source software. Soon, we will specify how to use CollaboRate with this model. We may also fund the development of CollaboRate with this model!

# Detailed Benefits for Employees and their Organizations
- Complete projects in record time using huge crowds of people. Never miss a customer deadline again!
- Fair and accurate income for employees and the organization.   
- No need for subjective appraisals done by humans. This ends a huge source of overhead, stress, conflict and injustice.  
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues:
  - No need to call employees to an office to keep an eye on them. Employees can work from home!
  - Reduce office cost. Or, end it altogether.
  - Employees can work for many projects and organizations at the same time. Organizations will not have security or productivity concerns.

# Detailed Benefits for Customers of IT Services
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Fair and accurate project cost
  - Superior code, documentation and design quality

# The Process, and How it Works
The process solves 5 challenges in the crowdsourcing of desk-job industries especially IT:  
- Share work among many
- Fair financials
- Fair risk sharing
- End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge
- Superior intellectual property security

Let's have a closer look at each solution.

1. **Share work among many.** The process is the best because it exploits the principle 'many hands make light work'. The crowd themselves break down the project work, such that you can use the most number of crowd members.  A [project governing body](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Project-Governing-Body) is also defined. It consists of one or more SPOCs ((Single Point of Contact)s). This arrangement solves the resulting issue 'too many cooks spoil the broth'. Yet, efforts needed from the project governing body are very small. The crowd does the most work possible, including [work breakdown review](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process). The governing body does activities needing low effort but high coordination/knowledge/trust. The governing body forms the core part of the organization or 'crowdsourcing vendor'.  

2. **Fair financials.** It defines a general-purpose and accurate measure of the smallest possible mental effort. We call this the microtask. Work measurement is very important for fairness and trust among all.  

   You pay workers X times the number of  microtasks that they do. X is the money per microtask that you pay. X is visible to the public.  
   
   The customer pays Y times the number of microtasks in the project. Y is the money per microtask that the customer pays.  
   
   Market forces may fix X and Y based on competition between crowdsourcing vendors. In future, government laws may even restrict their values to a pre-defined range.
   
   We define a microtask as follows:  

   **A microtask is the mental work done to break down an independent problem statement. The work breakdown usually yields two independent problem statements.**      
   **Sometimes, the problem statement is very small. It cannot break down into 2. Its solution is a single line of pseudocode. The mental work done to create this line is also a microtask.** 
   
   'Independent' problem statements refer neither to their parent nor to their sibling. In other words, a problem statement must be 'self-contained'. It description must be clear and complete. 
   
   A problem statement need not contain certain information if:
   - It is public
   - It is general knowledge to the problem's industry area (domain).
   
   We also refer to problem statements as tasks. So, in the context of CollaboRate there is a difference between tasks and microtasks.
   
   Written project requirements are tasks. A task is less than (say) 300 words of standard business English (2000 characters). We recommend the use of existing open source tools to check spellings, grammar and style.     
   
   The CollaboRate tool helps to perform the microtask (work breakdown of a task). A simple optional copy-paste feature eases creation of child tasks. After all, a child task is the same as the parent task, but with some text removed, changed and elaborated. 
   
   We will soon provide more advanced features to help with work breakdown, such as:
    - show 'missing context' errors
    - show strings that are common between the 2 child tasks
    - show strings that are exclusive to one of the 2 child tasks
    - show strings that are present in the parent task but are not present in either child task 

   The breakdown process continues such that requirement tasks break down into 'logic tasks'. The Collaborate tool helps to break down logic tasks. To do this, it asks the user a couple of simple questions. When you break down logic tasks, you also generate software program steps (pseudocode). So crowd members with no programming  background break down problems into code!  
   
   Each microtask is the same size for all practical purposes. With each breakdown, you reduce the number of requirements per task. But the size of the task text remains similar. To keep the child tasks independent from each other, they need elaboration. At the level of 'logic tasks', the text is small but the design effort is more. 
   
   This process may enhance the definition of microtask size later. Based on feedback, we may specify more financial weight for tasks with more text. Yet non-weighted microtasks are simple and fair enough for immediate use. More pay for tasks with more text, may cause crowd members to inflate the text of the child tasks.
   
   You manage tasks via any conventional bug tracking system. There are several available: Trac, Redmine, Bugzilla and so on. As you may know, you can use such systems to manage tasks as well.  
    
3. **Fair risk sharing.** The process reduces the risks of incorrect or  incomplete work for the customer. It does so by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Most people will still continue to earn well. We give ample time to do the microtask. Crowd members must pay a penalty that is in proportion to the amount of change need to fix the task description. This is of course fair. So they will agree to the [risk sharing process](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process).  

4. **End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge.** We end the risk caused by the need for skilled workers and project knowledge. This in turn allows mass participation. It provides earning opportunities for even the less capable. Here's how:  
   - The crowd member does not need to know the entire project scope. As mentioned above, each task must be independent and self-contained.
   -The crowd member does not need to know the codebase. The SPOCs decide whether the function described by the crowd member is new. An existing function could be part of the codebase under development. Or it could be a 'ready-made' function that is part of the programming language. Or a reusable software library may already have it. The knowledgeable SPOCs do this limited and specialized mental work. 
   - The crowd member does even need to know programming! Crowd members submit pseudo-code under guidance of the CollaboRate tool. We will soon refine the questions and options presented by the tool. Crowd members may not even realize that they are creating pseudocode. The SPOCs convert the pseudo-code to the actual lines of code. 
   - Since each crowd member works on one microtask at a time, the work per crowd member is as small and easy as possible.  
   
    We do expect the following skills from the crowd members:  
     - Read and write business English
     - Analytical capabilities 
     - Able to use the Internet to search for information
     - Willing to learn 'domain stuff' mentioned in the task. You only need to learn to the extent needed to break down the task into two subtasks.

5. **Superior intellectual property security.** This solution applies to commercial (closed-source) software development. Security increases with crowd size! The SPOCs will not share the codebase with the crowd members. A crowd member once assigned a task cannot refuse it. Otherwise, the financial penalties for an incomplete task apply. The tool's instructions warn crowd members to keep task details to themselves. You configure the task tracking system so that tasks are not public. Tasks will be visible only to the task creator, the task assignee and the SPOCs. No crowd member can see all the tasks, pseudocode and code. So you get superior intellectual property security.   

   What if you want to keep the project's goal a secret? For this, do work breakdown yourself to a particular level. Ensure that crowdsourced tasks do not give an understanding of the project goal. But the crowd may like to work on projects that have open and noble goals.  

   In case of *extra* rewards based on royalty, issues of trust may arise. You must resolve them as follows:  
   - You must provide transparency on the total number of microtasks and who did how many.
   - Crowd members might suspect that fake tasks/microtasks exist to change royalty percentages. You must define a way to resolve this suspicion. You need to balance information disclosure with intellectual property security. You can provide limited information such as tasks summaries. Or, you can provide full information to an investigative third party. We will later provide detailed solutions for this scenario.   

# Known limitations
- What if an initial problem statement is more than 2000 characters? In that case, the customer or SPOCs will have to themselves do the initial task breakdown. They can then crowdsource descendant tasks. 

Initial task breakdown will likely involve:
- requirement validation.
- conversion of tabular information to sentences.
- conversion of images and diagrams to sentences.
- Breaking large text into smaller independent texts. Paste sentences that explain the terms used, before the sentence to make independent.  

Requirements validation is very difficult to crowdsource. At present it is out of the scope of this project. 
We can automate the remaining activities. The creation of such automation tools is out of the scope of this project.  

# Questions?
We try to keep this document as clear and complete as possible. Yet you might have questions. Based on discussions with various people, we have compiled a list of FAQs [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). If your question is still not answered, please contact us at the email address given above.

# Challenges foreseen in process adoption
- The process is radical, even disruptive. We need to convince customers, organizations and people to try it out. Trial results and commercial success stories will further convince people to adopt it. The best way forward appears to be finding a customer. We can then create a startup organization that will act as the crowdsourcing vendor.
- Developers write hundreds of lines of code per day. They may find the process overhead unbearable. But they must keep in mind that it is a worthwhile trade-off to:
  - Ensure fairness and transparency for their fellow workers, if not for themselves.
  - Maximize the use of human minds for fast economic progress. This is after all, 'Artificial AI'!
  - Allow the masses to contribute to work that is important to the world. 
  - Speed up the project. After a point, the work *will* proceed faster with more people.
- We need to convince people to give a long enough trial period, a large enough team and enough work. Then we can prove that the CollaboRate process is better than the old way of working. So, people need to invest enough time and money in appropriate trials. They also need to expect learning from the trials. Based on the learning, we will enhance the CollaboRate process. People should not give up due to setbacks encountered. The core principle behind the process is sound.
- The process abstracts out technology and even simplifies algorithm thinking. People who want to learn software in-depth should use Collaborate only to earn. To learn, they can work on open source projects that do not use this process. Or they can study the source code of open source projects.  
   Yet using CollaboRate may teach people about structured thinking. It may encourage them to write very simple code. Such code would have only a couple of lines of code per function. It would also have excellent documentation.
- Do not worry about skill loss:
  - Software development training must not use CollaboRate. Even now, education systems provide a lot of knowledge that we may never use. One reason why may be to preserve the knowledge of mankind.  
  - There always will be a demand for technical SPOCs. We can rotate the technical SPOC responsibility. 
  - We will automate the tasks done by technical SPOCs. We will soon make this automation open source. We can preserve this open source. The world will not lose it. Then skills needed by technical SPOCs will be unnecessary. The need for technical SPOCs will end.

# Who's using it?
As of now, no one that we are aware of. We made the initial release of the process and tool on 17-Mar-17. We are discussing this project with various people. If you plan to try this tool, please contact us. We will share news of your initiative. A discussion forum has also been created at http://collaborateprocessandtool.freeforums.org. Crowd members, crowdsourcing vendors and their customers can connect using this forum. They can then conduct trials if not actual projects.  

   The CollaboRate project will manage itself using its own process and tool. You will be able to refer to the Issue Tracking System of GitHub as an example of how to use this process and tool.
   

# How to use the tool?
[Download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step  needed. Open CollaboRate.html in your web browser. I recommend FireFox. Answer the questions and follow the instructions shown by the wizard.

# Why the name 'CollaboRate' ?
This process and tool allows the most number of people possible, to work on the same project at the same time. It allows people to work over the internet with each other. It does so by ending complexity and security concerns. So it maximizes the power of collaboration. It also allows people to *rate* (appraise) each others' contributions. The rating is accurate, fair and transparent. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.

# Contributing
We need to understand, debate, test and stabilize the process and tool. We also need experiments to confirm the process and tool. We need to add more automation to the defined process. We need to add more intelligence to the tool and allow it to plug into issue/defect tracking systems. Volunteers may contact us at the contact email address mentioned above.
