# CollaboRate - a Crowdsourcing Process and Software Tool

# License Type

[MIT](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/blob/master/LICENSE)

# Purpose

CollaboRate is a process and a [simple software tool](https://sohrabsaran.github.io/CollaboRate/CollaboRate.html). It enables effective [crowdsourcing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) of commercial (closed-source) software development, testing, maintenance and support. It is the best project management process known so far. It will benefit customers of IT services. It will also benefit IT service companies and their employees alike. It may transform the way we do all desk jobs. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

You may use this process for open source projects as well. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Using-CollaboRate-for-Open-Source-Projects) for more information.

# Process Specifications

See the following links that will just specify the process without much attempt to explain it:
- [If you are a customer of an IT service company](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/CollaboRate-Process-Specification-for-Customers-of-an-IT-Service-Company)
- [If you are an IT service company](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/CollaboRate-Process-Specification-for-IT-Service-Companies)
- [If you are a crowd member](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/CollaboRate-Process-Specification-for-Crowd-Members)

# A Quick Overview for those familiar with Crowdsourcing Concepts
Those familiar with crowdsourcing concepts, may be impatient to know the basic ideas behind this crowdsourcing process. These ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/A-Quick-Overview-for-those-familiar-with-Crowdsourcing-Concepts).

# Detailed Purpose

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Enable a very large number of people (the crowd), to work on the same project at the same time".  

When this happens, the time taken for project completion reduces.  

Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  

So the chance of project success increases!  

More people can take part than ever before, in projects that are important to the world. Even an average person can now contribute. 

Do not worry if an important project gets over soon. It is ok to have a project done by many, and so have tiny rewards per worker per project. Because, there is enough work in the world. 

This process specifies that you reward crowd members for their actual effort. As an extra, you may choose to have royalty-based rewards for the crowd members. 

In the new process, you measure contributions exactly. You also measure the project's exact 'effort size'. The customer pays based on this size.  

So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all entities:  
the customer, the IT service company and the crowd.

Estimates from individual contributors are overheads and speculation. They cause disappointment, overwork and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, crowd members need not provide estimates. The customer of the IT service company does rough estimation of time and project size. We define a core part of the IT service company as the 'crowdsourcing vendor'. This group guides the customer in estimation. 

  The estimated size of the project must not exceed its budget. That's all we use estimates for. They are no longer needed for project duration and costing.  

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. At the same time, it solves the problem of how to accurately measure mental effort. It will be the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

# The Process, and how it Works
The process solves 5 challenges in the crowdsourcing of desk-job industries especially IT:  
- [Share work among many](#1-share-work-among-many)
- [Fair financials](#2-fair-financials)
- [Fair risk sharing](#3-fair-risk-sharing)
- [End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge](#4-end-the-risk-and-barrier-of-technical-and-project-knowledge)
- [Superior intellectual property security](#5-superior-intellectual-property-security)

Let's have a closer look at each solution.

## 1. **Share work among many.** 

The process is the best because it exploits the principle 'many hands make light work'. It also solves the resulting issue 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.

All work done by the crowd, is work breakdown. Work breakdown is a proven technique for project management. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure). 

   In the CollaboRate process, the work or 'task' broken down by one crowd member, can be further broken down by another crowd member. So, the project can use the most number of crowd members. The work breakdown continues until individual 'lines of code' are reached. The crowd does the most work possible to be crowdsourced, including the breakdown for the regression test automation suite.

   For coordination, task simplification and customer interaction, we need a [project governing body](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Project-Governing-Body). It consists of one or more SPOCs ((Single Point of Contact) s).Yet, efforts needed from the project governing body are very small. The governing body does activities that need low effort but high coordination/knowledge/trust. The governing body forms the core part of the organization or 'crowdsourcing vendor'.  

   The governing body manages tasks via any conventional bug tracking system. There are several available: Trac, Redmine, Bugzilla and so on. As you may know, you can use such systems to manage tasks as well.  
   
   Crowd members email the crowd interaction SPOC asking for work. The text of the task to be broken down is then emailed to the crowd member. The assigned crowd member will mail the breakdown of the task, to the crowd interaction SPOC. The crowd interaction SPOC will update the task tracking system on behalf of the crowd member. For open source projects, the crowd can directly interact with the task tracking system.

## 2. **Fair financials.** 

It defines a general-purpose and accurate measure of the smallest possible effort. We call this the microtask. Work measurement is very important for fairness and trust among all.  

   You pay workers X times the number of  microtasks that they do. X is the money per microtask that you pay. X is visible to the public.  
   
   The customer pays Y times the number of microtasks in the project. Y is the money per microtask that the customer pays.  
   
   We predict that:
   - Market forces will fix X and Y based on competition between crowdsourcing vendors. 
   - Later, labor unions may regulate these values. 
   - Finally, government laws will restrict their values to a pre-defined range.
   
   We define a microtask as follows:  

   **A microtask is the work done to break down an independent problem statement. The work breakdown yields two independent problem statements.**      
   **Sometimes, the problem statement is very small. It cannot break down into 2. Its solution is a single line of pseudocode. The work done to create this line is also a microtask.** 
   
   'Independent' problem statements refer neither to their parent nor to their sibling. In other words, a problem statement must be 'self-contained'. It description must be clear and complete. 
   
   A problem statement need not contain certain information if:
   - It is public
   - It is general knowledge to the problem's industry area (domain).
   
   We also refer to problem statements as tasks. So, in the context of CollaboRate there is a difference between tasks and microtasks.
   
   Written project requirements are tasks. A task is less than (say) 300 words of standard business English (2000 characters). We recommend the use of existing open source tools to check spellings, grammar and style.     
   
   The CollaboRate tool helps to perform the microtask (work breakdown of a task). Copy-paste and diff features ease creation of child tasks. After all, a child task is the same as the parent task, but with some text removed, changed and elaborated. 
   
   We will soon provide [advanced features](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Advanced-Work-Breakdown-Guidance) to help with work breakdown. 

   The breakdown process continues such that requirement tasks break down into 'logic tasks'. The CollaboRate tool helps to break down logic tasks. To do this, it asks the user a couple of simple questions. When you break down logic tasks, you also generate software program steps (pseudocode). So crowd members with no programming  background break down problems into code!  
   
   Each microtask takes almost the same effort. Why? With each breakdown, you reduce the number of requirements per task. But the effort needed to split the child task remains almost the same. This is because, to keep the child tasks independent from each other, they need more analysis and elaboration.
   
   At the level of 'logic tasks' the text does become much smaller, as it no longer needs elaboration. But the design effort will be the maximum, because the CollaboRate tool asks you more questions. 
   
   In summary the 'logic tasks' and 'requirement tasks' take approximately the same effort.
   
   This process may enhance the definition of microtask size later. Based on feedback, we may specify more financial weight for tasks with more text. Yet non-weighted microtasks are simple and fair enough for immediate use. In some cases, more pay for tasks with more text, may motivate crowd members to inflate the text of the child tasks.
   
   A task may refer to external data to be analyzed/processed. In this case, the task can be broken down into:
   - A child task that is based on the first/next data part to be analyzed/processed
   - A child task that is based on the remaining data part to be analyzed/processed

## 3. **Fair risk sharing.** 

The process reduces the risks of incorrect or  incomplete work for the customer. It does so by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Most people will still continue to earn well. We give ample time to do the microtask. Crowd members must pay a penalty that is in proportion to the amount of change needed to fix the task description. This is of course fair. So they will agree to the [risk sharing process](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process).  

[Back to parent](#the-process-and-how-it-works2)

## 4. **End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge.** 

We end the risk caused by the need for skilled workers and project knowledge. This in turn allows mass participation. It provides earning opportunities for even the less capable. Here's how:  

   - The crowd member does not need to know the entire project scope. As mentioned above, each task must be independent and self-contained.  
   - The crowd member does not even need to know programming! Crowd members submit pseudo-code under guidance of the CollaboRate tool. An option is present to change the terms used in the questions and options presented by the tool. These questions and options can then be understood by non-programmers. Crowd members familiar with programming terms, can choose to have commonly used programming terms in the tool's interface. Regardless of the terms used, the SPOCs convert the pseudo-code to the actual lines of code.
   - The crowd member does not need to know the project's code. Nor does the crowd member need to know the details of any software components it reuses. The SPOCs decide whether the function described by the crowd member is new. An existing function may already be part of the project code. Or it could be a 'built-in' function that is part of the programming language. Or a reusable software library may already have it. The knowledgeable SPOCs do this minor and specialized work.  
   Note that the SPOC may map a task to an existing function in a software library. The SPOC may then also create a new task to calculate the values of parameters to pass to this function.
   - Since each crowd member works on one microtask at a time, the work per crowd member is as small and easy as possible. But we expect the following skills from the crowd members:  
     - Read and write business English
     - Analytical capabilities 
     - Able to use the Internet to search for information
     - Willing to learn 'domain stuff' mentioned in the task. You only need to learn to the extent needed to break down the task into two subtasks.

[Back to parent](#the-process-and-how-it-works2)

## 5. **Superior intellectual property security.**

For commercial (closed-source) software development, security increases with crowd size! The SPOCs will share neither the project code nor the task tracking system with the crowd members. A crowd member once assigned a task cannot refuse it. Otherwise, the financial penalties for an incomplete task apply. The tool's instructions warn crowd members to keep task details to themselves. You configure the task tracking system so that tasks are not public. Tasks will be visible only to the task creator, the task assignee and the SPOCs. No crowd member can see all the tasks, pseudocode and code. So you get the best intellectual property security.   

   What if you want to keep the project's goal a secret? For this, do work breakdown yourself to a particular level. Ensure that crowdsourced tasks do not give an understanding of the project goal. But the crowd may like to work on projects that have open and noble goals. In case the project goal is kept confidential for business reasons, the crowdsourcing vendor must provide an assurance that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the project has good (noble, ethical) goals. The crowdsourcing vendor must also provide an assurance to reveal the nature of the project by a particular date.

In case of *extra* rewards based on royalty, a small security challenge arises. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Security-v-s-Transparency-in-case-of-Royalty-Incentives-for-Closed-Source-Software-Development) for more details.

# Software Testing, Maintenance and Customer Support

The CollaboRate tool does not yet specifically support Software Testing, Maintenance and Customer Support projects. But we can consider these processes to be subsets of Software Development processes. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Mapping-Software-Testing,-Maintenance-and-Customer-Support-to-Software-Development) for more details.

# Known limitations
- What if an initial problem statement is more than 2000 characters? In that case, the customer or SPOCs will have to themselves do the initial task breakdown. They can then crowdsource descendant tasks. 

Initial task breakdown will likely involve:
- Requirement validation.
- Conversion of tabular information to sentences.
- Conversion of images and diagrams to sentences.
- Breaking large text into smaller independent texts. Paste sentences that explain the terms used, before the sentence to make independent.  

Requirements validation is very difficult to crowdsource. At present it is out of the scope of this project. 
We can automate the remaining activities. The creation of such automation tools may be taken up later as a part of this project.

# Contributing
We need to understand, debate, test and stabilize the process and tool. We also need experiments to confirm the process and tool. We need to add more automation to the defined process. We need to add more intelligence to the tool and allow it to plug into issue/defect tracking systems. Volunteers may contact us at the contact email address mentioned above.

At present the project creator is the sole contributor visible in Github for this project. As additional volunteers sign up, creator would probably remain the main reviewer for the process refinements and tool features.

# Why the name 'CollaboRate'?
This process and tool allows the most number of people possible, to work on the same project at the same time. It allows people to work over the internet with each other. It does so by ending complexity and security concerns. So it maximizes the power of collaboration. It also allows people to *rate* (appraise) each other's contributions, especially if the project's task tracker is accessible to all the people. The rating is accurate, fair and transparent. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.
