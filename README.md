# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a tool, process and philosophy to facilitate crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development, testing, maintenance and support, to a level where it becomes the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. It may be useful for any collaborative intellectual endeavor outside software development. It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based enconomy, to give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn. 

# Who's using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool, as well as the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Features
 The tool, process and philosophy aim to provide the following features ([see the project wiki page for a more detailed overview of the features](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki#features)):
- Define a universal, accurate and indisputable measure of intellectual work. This will form the sole basis for determining the earnings of the crowd member. People can earn as much (or as less) as they deserve, based solely on their true intellectual effort.
- Maximize security of the intellectual property of the project.
- Maximally reduced complexity of work. This in turn will allow more opportunties for people to make a living, contribute meaningfully and be financially successful.
- Allow people to be simultaneously associated with multiple projects and organizations, without the risks of traditional freelancing.
- The tool can be used for software testing, maintenance and support as well.
- Benefits for project customers:
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Where do I begin to learn?
You are encouraged to start playing around with the tool and also simultaneously read up on the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki).

Once the tool, process and philosophy are fully stabilized, understood and popularized, existing large IT organizations or a community of people working part-time can start experiments with the process and the tool, in order to validate its expected benefits.

# What is the basic technical usage of the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
3. To use the tool, just download a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
