# CollaboRate - a Crowdsourcing Process and Software Tool

# What is CollaboRate?

CollaboRate is a process and a [simple software tool](https://sohrabsaran.github.io/CollaboRate/CollaboRate.html). It is the best IT project management process known so far. It enables many software project activities to be [crowdsourced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing), even in commercial (closed-source) projects. This results in extremely fast project completion time. CollaboRate enables crowdsourcing more effectively than any other known crowdsourcing method. 

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Enable a very large number of people (the crowd), to work on the same project at the same time".  

Another related goal of CollaboRate is to measure work done by people, in a way that is automatic and accurate.

The CollaboRate process will benefit IT service companies, their customers and their employees alike. It may transform the way we do all desk jobs. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

This process will also be used in open source projects. It is especially useful along with open source business models. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Using-CollaboRate-for-Open-Source-Projects) for more information.

# Benefits for Customers of IT Services  

|Benefit|How is it achieved?|
|-------|-------------------|
|Reduced financial risk|The financial risks of delayed or defective work are borne in fair proportion by the several workers (the crowd). They will easily understand and agree to this concept.|
|Fair and accurate project cost, and tracking of the work done|Work is given out and measured in tiny pieces called 'microtasks'. These microtasks are almost identical in size+complexity.|
|Faster time to completion|Bulk of the work is crowdsourced. Here we assume large crowd availability and enough incentive per microtask. These assumptions are safe and controllable.|
|Superior code, documentation and design quality|Crowdsourced activities are based on clear, peer-reviewed documentation and step-by-step design.|
|Best possible intellectual property protection for closed-source projects|None of the crowd members have access to the code or the task tracking system. They are repeatedly warned not to share details of the task worked on, with anyone else|

# Benefits for IT Services Companies and their Employees


|Benefit|How is it achieved?|
|-------|-------------------|
|Complete projects in record time using huge crowds of people. Never miss a customer deadline again!|Deadlines are assumed to remain conventional, until industry expectations change due to widespread use of CollaboRate.|
|Fair and accurate income for employees and the organization.|Work is given out and measured in tiny pieces called 'microtasks'. These microtasks are almost identical in size+complexity. Due to extremely fast project completion time, customer is charged based on actual work, rather than estimated work.|
|No need for subjective appraisals done by humans. Individual performance is now simple to measure.|Individual performance is measured by the number of microtasks done by the individual. If you suspect foul play by the crowdsourcing vendor, you can compare your performance with that of other crowd members. In case of additional royalty-based compensation on software product development, you can also ask the vendor to disclose limited proof of the ratio of your contributions to the total contributions of the crowd.|  
|Unlimited earning potential|Organization can now clearly explain large differences in earnings between various employees. They do not need to 'moderate salaries' in a purely performance-linked compensation system.|   
|Unlimited ability to take it easy| Because of the huge crowd of people available to work on the proect, employees can also work as little as they need to (say, due to personal emergencies, or need for vacation) without anyone worrying about impact to the project.|   
|Minimal software and hardware costs. No development environment setup | As per the CollaboRate process, the crowd does not need to write or test code. They do not need a development environment. They need only an internet connection, a web browser and an email account. Almost everyone has a laptop or smartphone nowadays, with an internet connection.| 
|Project security is no longer an issue|The CollaboRate process specifies that for closed source projects, crowd members cannot access the task tracking system or code repository. The process ensures that crowd works on tiny pieces of work at a time, called microtasks. No crowd member gets to see the project code. Visibility into project design is limited to the microtasks worked on by the crowd member. Microtasks given to the crowd member will be as unrelated as possible to each other, so that the project design is minimally exposed.|
|Project complexity is no longer an issue|The CollaboRate process ensures that crowd works on tiny pieces of work at a time, called microtasks. The analysis and reading that needs to be done by each crowd member per microtask, is quite small. This ends complexity.|
|No need to call the crowd to an office to keep an eye on them. Most employees can work from home!|Project security, complexity and development environment are no longer issues for the crowd.|
|Reduce office cost. Or, end it altogether.|No need to call the crowd to an office to keep an eye on them.|
|Employees that comprise the crowd, can work for many projects and organizations at the same time.| Organizations will not have security or productivity concerns. Employees can work from home.|

# The Recipe
Those familiar with crowdsourcing concepts, may be impatient to know the basic ideas or design goals, behind this crowdsourcing process. These ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/A-Quick-Overview-for-those-familiar-with-Crowdsourcing-Concepts).

# Detailed Purpose

When a very large number of people (the crowd), are able to work on the same project at the same time, the time taken for project completion reduces.  

Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  

So the chance of project success increases!  

More people can take part than ever before, in projects that are important to the world. Even an average person can now contribute. 

Do not worry if an important project gets over soon. It is ok to have a project done by many, and so have tiny rewards per worker per project. Because, there is enough work in the world. 

This process specifies that you reward crowd members for their actual effort. As an extra, you may choose to have royalty-based rewards for the crowd members. 

In the new process, you measure contributions exactly. You also measure the project's exact 'effort size'. The customer pays based on this size.  

So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all entities:  
the customer, the IT service company and the crowd.

Estimates from individual contributors are overheads and speculation. They cause disappointment, overwork and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, crowd members need not provide estimates. The customer of the IT service company does rough estimation of time and project size. We define a core part of the IT service company as the 'crowdsourcing vendor'. This group guides the customer in estimation. 

  The estimated size of the project must not exceed its budget. That's all we use estimates for. They are no longer needed for project duration and costing.  

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. At the same time, it solves the problem of how to accurately measure work. It will be the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

# The Process, and how it Works
The process solves 5 challenges in the crowdsourcing of desk-job industries especially IT:  
- [Share work among many](#1-share-work-among-many)
- [Fair financials](#2-fair-financials)
- [Fair risk sharing](#3-fair-risk-sharing)
- [End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge](#4-end-the-risk-and-barrier-of-technical-and-project-knowledge)
- [Best intellectual property security](#5-best-intellectual-property-security)

Let's have a closer look at each solution.

## 1. **Share work among many.** 

The process is the best because it exploits the principle 'many hands make light work'. It also solves the resulting issue 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.

All work done by the crowd, is work breakdown. Work breakdown is a proven technique for project management. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure). 

   In the CollaboRate process, the work or 'task' broken down by one crowd member, can be further broken down by another crowd member. So, the project can use the most number of crowd members. The work breakdown continues until individual 'lines of code' are reached. The crowd does the most work possible to be crowdsourced, including the breakdown for the regression test automation suite.

   Every project needs a [project governing body](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Project-Governing-Body) to oversee the work of the crowd. It consists of one or more individuals called SPOCs ((Single Point of Contact) s). Yet, efforts needed from the project governing body are small. The governing body does activities that need low effort but high coordination/knowledge/trust. The governing body forms the core part of the organization or 'crowdsourcing vendor'. Because of the use of SPOCs for certain technical activies, the crowdsourcing done via the CollaboRate process, is partial. The governing body takes care of customer interaction, financial operations, initial task creation, coordination, acceptance testing, use of third-party software and keeping the code modular.

   The governing body manages tasks via any conventional bug tracking system. There are several available: Trac, Redmine, Bugzilla and so on. As you may know, you can use such systems to manage tasks as well.  
   
   Crowd members email the crowd interaction SPOC asking for work. The text of the task to be broken down is then emailed to the crowd member. The assigned crowd member will mail the breakdown of the task, to the crowd interaction SPOC. The crowd interaction SPOC will update the task tracking system on behalf of the crowd member. 
   
   For open source projects, the crowd can directly interact with the task tracking system. For closed source projects, the work done by the crowd interaction SPOC can easily be automated. The crowd could interact with a website rather than via email. This web application can then update the database of the defect tracking system. Creation of this web app may be taken into the scope of the CollaboRate project in the near future, and defined as one of its main goals.

## 2. **Fair financials.** 

It defines a general-purpose and accurate measure of the smallest possible effort. We call this the microtask. Work measurement is very important for fairness and trust among all.  

   You pay workers X times the number of  microtasks that they do. X is the money per microtask that you pay. X is visible to the public.  
   
   The customer pays Y times the number of microtasks in the project. Y is the money per microtask that the customer pays.  
   
   We predict that:
   - Market forces will fix X and Y based on competition between crowdsourcing vendors. 
   - Later, labor unions may regulate these values. 
   - Finally, government laws will restrict their values to a pre-defined range.
   
   We define a microtask as follows:  

   **A microtask is the work done to break down an independent problem statement. The work breakdown yields two independent problem statements.**
   **Sometimes, the problem statement is very small. It cannot break down into 2. Its solution is a single line of pseudocode. The work done to create this line is also a microtask.** 

<a id="binaryworkbreakdown">&nbsp;</a>
   We break down a problem statement into a maximum of 2 parts (and not more) because it is the smallest possible work that we can do on that problem statement. We term such a work breakdown as a 'binary work breakdown'.
   
   'Independent' problem statements refer neither to their parent nor to their sibling. In other words, a problem statement must be 'self-contained'. It description must be clear and complete.
   
   A problem statement need not contain certain information if:
   - It is public
   - It is general knowledge to the problem's industry area (domain).
   
   We also refer to problem statements as tasks. So, in the context of CollaboRate there is a difference between tasks and microtasks.
   
   Written project requirements are tasks. A task is less than or equal to 2000 characters (around 300 words of standard business English). We recommend the use of existing open source tools to check spellings, grammar and style.     
   
   The CollaboRate tool helps to perform the microtask (work breakdown of a task). Copy-paste and diff features ease creation and self-review of child tasks. After all, a child task is the same as the parent task, but with some text removed, changed and elaborated. 
   
   We will soon provide [advanced features](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Advanced-Work-Breakdown-Guidance) for further help with work breakdown. 

   The breakdown process continues such that requirement tasks break down into 'logic tasks'. The CollaboRate tool helps to break down logic tasks. To do this, it asks the user a couple of simple questions. When you break down logic tasks, you also generate software program steps (pseudocode). So crowd members with no programming  background break down problems into code!  
   
   Each microtask takes almost the same effort. Why? With each breakdown, you reduce the number of requirements per task. But the effort needed to split the child task remains almost the same. This is because, to keep the child tasks independent from each other, they need more analysis and elaboration.
   
   At the level of 'logic tasks' the text does become much smaller, as it no longer needs elaboration. But the design effort will be the maximum, because the CollaboRate tool asks you more questions. 
   
   In summary the 'logic tasks' and 'requirement tasks' take approximately the same effort.
   
   This process may enhance the definition of microtask size later. Based on feedback, we may specify more financial weight for tasks with more text. Yet non-weighted microtasks are simple and fair enough for immediate use. In some cases, more pay for tasks with more text, may motivate crowd members to inflate the text of the child tasks.
   
   A task may refer to external data to be analyzed/processed. In this case, the task can be broken down into:
   - A child task that is based on the first/next data part to be analyzed/processed
   - A child task that is based on the remaining data part to be analyzed/processed
   
   If you come across a task that cannot be broken down into 2 parts, but needs to be directly broken down into more than 2 parts, let us know!
   
   The compensation for SPOCs is based on the number of microtasks each SPOC worked on.
   
   What if an initial problem statement is more than 2000 characters? In that case, the customer or SPOCs will have to themselves do the initial task breakdown. They can then crowdsource these tasks as 'initial tasks' that will be within the specified character limit. 

   Initial task breakdown will likely involve:
   - Requirement validation.
   - Conversion of tabular information to sentences (tool can be developed to automate this).
   - Conversion of images and diagrams to sentences.
   - Breaking large text into smaller independent texts. Paste sentences that explain the terms used, before the sentence to make independent (tool can be developed to speed up this procedure).  

   Requirements validation can be crowdsourced to a certain extent. All the SPOCs need to do is to ensure that the work breakdown done by them to create the initial tasks, is free of any mistakes. However the customer may not appreciate their invalid requirements being caught by the crowd. Unless, the customer appreciates that the crowd has more eyes available to quickly validate the requirements. We suggest the crowdsourcing vendor to validate the requirements with the customer as much as possible, before crowdsourcing them.

## 3. **Fair risk sharing.** 

The process reduces the risks of incorrect or incomplete work for the customer. Harsh and unappealing though it may seem, it needs to do so, by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Do not be worried though. Most crowd members will still continue to earn well. We give 24 hours to do the microtask, whereas most people should be able to do the microtask in a couple of minutes. Also, the CollaboRate tool allows crowd members to self-review the descriptions they create for their child tasks, further reducing the chances of mistakes.

In case of bugs, crowd members must pay a penalty that is in proportion to the amount of change needed to fix the task description. This is of course fair. So they will agree to the [risk sharing process](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Quality-Process-and-Risk-Sharing-Process).  

[Back to parent](#the-process-and-how-it-works)

## 4. **End the risk and barrier of technical and project knowledge.** 

We end the risk caused by the need for skilled workers and project knowledge. This in turn allows mass participation. It provides earning opportunities for even the less capable. Here's how:  

   - The crowd member does not need to know the entire project scope. As mentioned above, each task must be independent and self-contained.  
   - The crowd member does not even need to know programming! Crowd members submit pseudo-code under guidance of the CollaboRate tool. An option is present to change the terms used in the questions and options presented by the tool. So, programmers and non-programmers alike will find it comfortable to use the tool. Regardless of the terms used, the SPOCs will be able convert the pseudo-code to the actual lines of code.
   - The crowd member does not need to know the project's code. Nor does the crowd member need to know the details of any software components it reuses. The SPOCs decide whether the function described by the crowd member is new. An existing function may already be part of the project code. Or it could be a 'built-in' function that is part of the programming language. Or a reusable software library may already have it. The knowledgeable SPOCs do this minor and specialized work.  
   Note that the SPOC may map a task to an existing function in a software library. The SPOC may then also create a new task to calculate the values of parameters to pass to this function.
   - Since each crowd member works on one microtask at a time, the work per crowd member is as small and easy as possible. But we expect the following skills from the crowd members:  
     - Read and write business English
     - Analytical capabilities 
     - Able to use the Internet to search for information
     - Willing to learn 'domain stuff' mentioned in the task. You only need to learn to the extent needed to break down the task into two subtasks.

[Back to parent](#the-process-and-how-it-works2)

## 5. **Best intellectual property security.**

For commercial (closed-source) software development, security increases with crowd size! The SPOCs will share neither the project code nor the task tracking system with the crowd members. A crowd member once assigned a task cannot refuse it. Otherwise, the financial penalties for an incomplete task apply. The tool's instructions warn crowd members to keep task details to themselves. Ensure that tasks will be visible only to the task creator, the task assignee and the SPOCs. No crowd member can see all the tasks, pseudocode and code. So you get the best intellectual property security.   

   What if you want to keep the project's goal a secret? For this, do work breakdown yourself to a particular level. Ensure that crowdsourced tasks do not give an understanding of the project goal. But the crowd may like to work on projects that have open and noble goals. 
   
   The project goal may be kept confidential for business competition reasons. In this case, the crowdsourcing vendor must provide an assurance that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the project has good (noble, ethical) goals. The crowdsourcing vendor must also provide an assurance to reveal the nature of the project by a particular date.

   In case of *extra* rewards based on royalty, a small security challenge arises. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Security-v-s-Transparency-in-case-of-Royalty-Incentives-for-Closed-Source-Software-Development) for more details.

# Summary of Activities Currently Crowdsourced

As stated in the introduction, not everything is crowdsourced under the CollaboRate process. Yet the activities that are crowdsourced, are expected to account for a significant portion of the project work. These activities are as follows:
- detailed requirement validation (in case invalid requirements slip through to the crowd) 
- design and code documentation
- design and partial development (break down of requirements into use cases, and then into pseudocode)
- partial testing (of the work done by the other crowd members)
- test automation development

# Software Testing, Maintenance and Customer Support

The questions and options presented by the CollaboRate tool, do not yet specifically support Software Testing, Maintenance and Customer Support projects. But we can consider these processes to be subsets of Software Development processes. See [this page](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Mapping-Software-Testing,-Maintenance-and-Customer-Support-to-Software-Development) for how to adapt the CollaboRate process and tool for these type of projects.

Note that for maintenance projects whose source code is not already in XD (Extreme Documentation) format:
- the skill levels needed by the crowd for maintenance projects are higher
- the code to be maintained needs to be open to the crowd.
       
[Back To Contents](#contents)

# Known Limitations

Some activities are not crowdsourced under the CollaboRate process. This is because they may need a lot of knowledge, coordination or trust. It is difficult to find a way to make the crowd reliably perform these activities. Moreover some of these activities may be difficult to measure accurately. So it is difficult to reward the crowd with accuracy for these activities.   

The following activities are not crowdsourced under the CollaboRate process:
- requirement validation and initial work breakdown needed to start the crowdsourcing process
- validation that the use cases created by the crowd, cover the requirements
- initial manual testing to determine correctness of the regression test automation
- debugging and raising defects
- look and feel, UI design
- pseudocode to code conversion
- code modularization
- opportunities for reusing third-party code

Yet in the CollaboRate process, the non-crowdsourced activities are done in a very different way. This provides additional benefits, such as work measurement and division of labor. It also makes it easy to find ways to automate these activities. 

As this project progresses, we expect to devise further processes and/or develop further tools, to address the above-mentioned activities, such that they are either crowdsourced or automated to a large extent.

# Why the name 'CollaboRate'?
This process and tool allows the most number of people possible, to work on the same project at the same time. It allows people to work over the internet with each other. It does so by ending complexity and security concerns. So it maximizes the power of collaboration. It also allows people to *rate* (appraise) each other's contributions, especially if the project's task tracker is accessible to all the people. The rating is accurate, fair and transparent. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.
