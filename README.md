# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a tool and a process to facilitate crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development to a level where it becomes the most common way of software development. It holds the promise of allowing the maximum number of people possible, to simultaneously work on the same project. People can collaborate with each other in a for-profit, closed-source model that protects the intellectual property of the crowd as a whole. At the same time, it allows people to rate each other's contributions in an as-transparent-as-possible, accurate and indisputable way. Hence the name 'CollaboRate'.

# How is it useful?
Once the process and the tool are stabilized and popularized, existing large IT organizations or a community of people working part-time can start experiments with the process and the tool. The process and the tool allow the following to be possible:
- Accurate and indisputable measure of work that will form the sole basis for determining the earnings of the crowd member. This eliminates errors and injustices done when humans appraise people. People can earn as much as they want, based solely on their true intellectual effort.
- Intellectual property protection of the total work done by the other crowd members from each crowd member, as well as maximally reduced complexity of work will allow people to work from home, over the internet.
- This model can be copied outside the software/IT industry and be applied in general to transform our job-based society to one where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# How does it work?
The tool and process significantly address issues related to software work measurement and intellectual property theft mitigation. They also reduce task complexity and prior project/technical knowledge needed to participate in the project, to a minimum. This in turn allows for mass participation by a large number of people (the 'crowd') in the project. 

# How to use it?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
