# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a process and a very simple software tool. It will radically transform the commercial IT industry. Also, it may probably transform other intellectual-property intensive industries. CollaboRate enables effective crowdsourcing of commercial (closed-source) software development, testing, maintenance and support. It is the best project management process, model and technology known so far. It will bring vast benefits to customers, organizations and employees alike. It will significantly boost global economic and technology progress. 

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as "having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project at the same time".  
When this happens, the time taken for project completion is greatly reduced.
So the need for estimation of the project end date is greatly reduced. The need for estimates to be provided by crowd members, is eliminated.  
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project, which is course, very easy to do.  
Due to fast execution time, no dependency on specific people in the crowd, and easy work for all the crowd members, the chance of project success is greatly increased.  
Last but not least, any crowd member is easily able to measure exactly what he/she or some other member has contributed to the project. The organization is also able to measure the project's 'intellectual effort size' accurately and charge the customer accordingly.
All this results in greatly increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for the customer, organization and the crowd members alike.

The process and tool systematically solve the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. It will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry, due to the benefits that it will provide customers, organizations and employees alike. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff), who will be considered as the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. Developers could earn via this model, perhaps in conjunction with other open source business models such as open-source bounty.

It may be useful for any collaborative intellectual endeavor outside software development.  It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based economy, to give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# How it works (an overview)

The process comprehensively addresses 5 pain areas of the traditional intellectual-property-based and job-based economy, in novel ways:  
1. It defines a general-purpose, highly accurate and transparent measure of intellectual effort. This is very important to ensure fairness and trust amongst all the project members and stakeholders. This is rightly used in place of estimations, as the measure by which to reward crowd members and charge the customer. The CollaboRate tool is used to ensure that intellectual effort is always contributed in an accurately measurable way.  
2. For the customer, it ensures that the risks of incorrect or incomplete work are reduced. It does so by fairly sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members. For the capabilities of most people, there would be high earning potential and a low chance of getting penalized for incorrect or incomplete work. So most people will agree to the risk sharing process.  
3. It ensures that technical, codebase and requirements knowledge needed to participate in the project are negligible, and that the work per crowd member is very small and therefore very easy. The CollaboRate tool facilitates performing the small work. This allows more inclusive participation by the crowd, and in turn reduces project risk.  
4. It defines a way for a large number of people to smoothly participate in the same project, with minimal efforts needed from the project governing body. The CollaboRate tool facilitates the division of project work such that the project can utilize the maximum number of crowd members.  
5. It ensures superior intellectual property security, that paradoxically increases with crowd size!  

#Detailed benefits for employees and their organizations
- Variable wage-based income accurately proportional to contributions of the employee. 
  - No need for subjective appraisals done by humans, eliminating a huge source of workplace conflict and injustice
  - Crowd members will earn fairly based on their contributions
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues:
  - No need to call employees to an office and keep an eye on them. So employees can work from home.
  - Employees can work for multiple projects and organizations at the same time with security concerns from any organization.

# Detailed benefits for customers
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Who's using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool, as well as the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Getting started
First please read the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki).

# How to use the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue/bug tracking system, and by forming a team of a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance, architecting, customer interaction and crowd interaction. Though the tool attempts to provide instructions about the process to follow, it is probably better to go through the documentation first (that covers the philosophy and the overall process). This will help to better understand where and why the tool is used in the overall recommended process.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do the smallest (easiest) possible intellectual/software work.
3. To use the tool, just [download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
