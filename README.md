# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a set of philosophies, processes and a very simple software tool, that will revolutionize the commercial IT industry and probably also other intellectual-property intensive industries. It facilitates crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development, testing, maintenance and support. 

Here crowdsourcing means having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project.  
So the time taken for project completion is greatly reduced.  
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project, which is very easy.  
So the chance of project success is greatly increased.  
Last but not least, crowd members are able to easily able to measure what they and others have contributed to the project, in an almost indisputable way.
All this results in greatly increased and inclusive earning potential for crowd members, who are mostly ordinary IT workers such as you and I!

The process and tool systematically solve the challenges seen when we have a very large number of people working on the same project. So it will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry, due to the benefits that it will provide customers, organizations and IT workers alike. The most interesting benefits would be for IT workers who will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. Developers could earn via this model, perhaps in conjunction with other open source business models such as open-source bounty.

It may be useful for any collaborative intellectual endeavor outside software development.  It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based economy, to give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# Who's using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool, as well as the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Features
 The tool, process and philosophy aim to provide the following features ([see the project wiki page for a more detailed overview of the features](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki#features)):
- Define a universal, accurate and indisputable measure of intellectual work. This will form the sole basis for determining the earnings of the crowd member. People can earn as much (or as less) as they deserve, based solely on their true intellectual effort.
- Maximize security of the intellectual property of the project.
- Maximally reduced complexity of work. This in turn will allow more opportunties for people to make a living, contribute meaningfully and be financially successful.
- Allow people to be simultaneously associated with multiple projects and organizations, without the risks of traditional freelancing.
- The tool can be used for software testing, maintenance and support as well.
- Benefits for project customers:
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Getting started
First please read the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki).

# How to use the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting. Though the tool attempts to provide instructions about the process to follow, it is probably better to go through the documentation first (that covers the philosophy and the overall process). This will help to better understand where and why the tool is used in the overall recommended process.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
3. To use the tool, just [download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
