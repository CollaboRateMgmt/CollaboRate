# What is CollaboRate?
CollaboRate is a tool, process and philosophy to facilitate crowdsourcing of for-profit, closed-source software development, testing, maintenance and support, to a level where it becomes the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The system can trivially be used for open source development as well. It may be useful for any collaborative initiative beyond software development. It may be applied in general to overcome the limitations of the job-based enconomy to one where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# Features
 The process and the tool allow the following to be possible:
- Accurate and indisputable measure of work. This will form the sole basis for determining the earnings of the crowd member. This eliminates errors and injustices done when humans appraise people. People can earn as much as they want, based solely on their true intellectual effort.
- Increased security of the intellectual property of the project from each crowd member especially when the crowd size per project is maximized
- Maximally reduced complexity of work will allow more opportuntie for people to contribute, make a living and be financially successful in a fair, logical and sustainable way
- The increased security and reduced complexity features will in turn allow people to work from home, over the internet, and can potentially allow people to be simultaneously associated with multiple projects and organiation, without the risks of traditional freelancing
- Though the tool is aimed at software development, it can be used for software testing, maintenance and support as well, through defined processes and philosophies.
- Benefits for project customers:
  - Faster time to completion especially when the crowd size per project is maximized
  - Reduced financial risk especially when the crowd size per project is maximized, through a set of defined processes that shares the financial risks and burdens with the crowd
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality, through processes that effectively define technical role specializations and SPOCs (Single Point of Contacts) who are responsible for integration and review the work done by the crowd. The work done by the SPOCs can further be supported, reduced and eventually eliminated by indentified software tools, that can be created (or may already exist) as separate open source projects.

# How does it work?
The tool and process significantly address issues related to software work measurement and intellectual property theft mitigation. This allows organizations/project to not have to rely on traditional methods of appraising people and keeping an eye on them in an 'office' location.

The tool and process also reduce task complexity and prior project/technical knowledge needed to participate in the project, to a minimum. This in turn allows for mass participation by a large number of people (the 'crowd') in the project. People are free to do as much or as little work as they can, when they can and where they can. Though anyone can take up any work, a system of financial penalties exists so that crowd members cannot cause harm to the project. In general most people except the really unintelligent would find a vast earning potential despite this system of financial penalties in place.

Once the process and the tool are stabilized and popularized, existing large IT organizations or a community of people working part-time can start experiments with the process and the tool, in order to validate its expected benefits.

# How to use it?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue tracking system and a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance and architecting.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do easiest possible software work in an indisputably measurable way.
3. To read the details of the process please visit the online documentation of this project at https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki
4. To use the tool, just download a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
