# Purpose
CollaboRate is a process and a very simple software tool. It will transform the commercial IT industry! It enables effective crowdsourcing of commercial (closed-source) software development, testing, maintenance and support. It is the best project management process, model and technology known so far. It will bring vast benefits to customers, organizations and employees alike. It will boost global economic and technology progress. 

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project at the same time".  

When this happens, the time taken for project completion reduces.
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  
So the chance of project success increases.  

Estimations from the individual contributors are an overhead and a speculative activity. They lead to friction and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion time, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, we end the need for estimates from crowd members. 

Due to the new process, crowd members can measure each others' contributions exactly. The organization is also able to measure the project's exact 'intellectual effort size'. The customer pays based on this size.  

So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all:  
customer, organization and the crowd.

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. It will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

You may use this process for open source development as well. Open Source collaborators could work together better with this process. They may even wish to earn via this process. You can use this process with other open source business models. The open-source bounty model is one such promising business model.

It may be useful for any collaborative project outside IT, that involves only desk work. You may apply it to overcome the  general limitations of the desk-job-based economy. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# How it works

The process solves 5 pain areas of desk-job industries especially IT, in novel ways:  
1. The process is better than others because it exploits the principle that 'many hands make light work'. The crowd themselves break down the project work, such that you can use the most number of crowd members.  A [project governing body](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Project-Governing-Body) made up of one or more SPOCs ((Single Point of Contact)s) solves the resulting issue 'too many cooks spoil the broth'. However efforts needed from the project governing body are very small. The crowd does the maximum work possible, including [work breakdown review]. The governing body does activities that are best done by trusted single point of contacts. The governing body forms the core part of the organization or 'crowdsourcing vendor'.
2. It defines a general-purpose and accurate measure of the smallest possible intellectual effort - the microtask. Work measurement is very important for fairness and trust among all. You use the number of microtasks multiplied by a monetary value per microtask, to reward crowd members. You charge the customer based on the number of microtasks in the project.  
The project requirements form problem statements. A problem statement is less than (say) 300 words of standard business English. A micro-task is defined as breaking down a problem statement into 2 independent problem statements. By 'independent' we mean that child problem statements do not need to refer to each other or the parent problem statement.  
The CollaboRate tool helps to perform the microtask (work breakdown). A simple copy-paste feature eases creation of child problem statements. The tool will later provide more advanced features to validate the child problem statements.  
Microtasks are managed via any conventional bug tracking system.  
To promote trust in the crowdsourcing vendor, the vendor must share with the crowd members the following:
   - the names and contact details of the crowd members
   - the number of microtasks done by each member 
   - the total number of microtasks in the project  
Crowdsourcing vendors will define a mechanism to resolve suspicions raised by crowd members over the number of microtasks done by any particular crowd member. Limited information about the summary of the problem statements broken down by the crowd member suspected of being favored, can be be provided to suspiscious crowd member, or an investigating third party in an automated or manual way.  
3. The process reduces the risks of incorrect or  incomplete work for the customer. It does so by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Most people will still continue to earn well. So they will agree to the [risk sharing process](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki/Risk-Sharing-Process).  
4. The following allows for more inclusive participation and reduces project risk:  
   - The crowd member does not need to know the entire project requirement. As mentioned above, each problem statement to be broken down, is supposed to be independent - you do not need to look up any other documentation to understand it. 
   - The crowd member does not need to know the codebase. The crowd member does not even have to know programming! Crowd members submit pseudo-code under guidance of the CollaboRate tool. The SPOCs convert the pseudo-code to the actual lines of code. They also decide whether the function described by the crowd member is a new or existing function. An existing function could be part of the codebase under development. Or it could be a 'ready-made' function that is part of the programming language. Or it could be part of a software library that can and should be reused. This limited analysis and recollection from memory, is left to the knowledgeable SPOCs.  
   - Since work is done as micro-tasks, the work per crowd member is as small and easy as possible.  
   
  The process expects only the following skills from the crowd members:  
    - sufficient knowledge of business English
    - sufficient analytical capabilities 
    - an ability to surf the Net and understand to the needed level, domain concepts referenced in the problem statement

5. It ensures superior intellectual property security. Security increases with crowd size! The SPOCs will not share the codebase with the crowd members. A task assignment once assigned to a crowd member cannot be refused, otherwise the financial penalties for an incomplete task apply. Crowd members are enlightened to keep details of the tasks that they have worked on only to themselves. The task tracking system will be configured so that only the needed crowd members can see a particular task. Since the project is split into a very large number of micro-tasks and each crowd member sees only a tiny part of the design/pseudo-code, you get intellectual property security.       

# Detailed benefits for employees and their organizations
- Variable income in accurate proportion to contributions of the employee.   
- No need for subjective appraisals done by humans. This ends a huge source of overhead, stress, conflict and injustice.  
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues:
  - No need to call employees to an office and keep an eye on them. So employees can work from home.
  - Employees can work for many projects and organizations at the same time. Organizations will not have security or productivity concerns.

# Detailed benefits for customers
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality
