# Purpose
CollaboRate is a process and a very simple software tool. It will transform the commercial IT industry! It enables effective crowdsourcing of commercial (closed-source) software development, testing, maintenance and support. It is the best project management process, model and technology known so far. It will bring vast benefits to customers, organizations and employees alike. It will boost global economic and technology progress. 

In the context of CollaboRate, we define 'crowdsourcing' as follows:  
"Having a very large number of people (the crowd) working on the same project at the same time".  

When this happens, the time taken for project completion reduces.
Also, each person has to contribute very little to the project. This is of course very easy to do.  
So the chance of project success increases.  

Estimations from the individual contributors are an overhead and a speculative activity. They lead to friction and exploitation.  
Due to fast completion time, the need for estimating the exact project end date reduces. As per the new process, we end the need for estimates from crowd members. 

Due to the new process, crowd members can measure each others' contributions exactly. The organization is also able to measure the project's exact 'intellectual effort size'. The customer pays based on this size.  

So, we get increased, inclusive and fair earning potential for all:  
customer, organization and the crowd.

The process solves the problems seen with a very large number of people working on the same project. It will become the most common way of working in the commercial IT industry. The most exciting benefits would be for the common IT employees (technical staff). They will become the crowd. They will enjoy more transparency, freedom and opportunities than ever before.

You may use this process for open source development as well. Open Source collaborators could work together better with this process. They may even wish to earn via this process. You can use this process with other open source business models. The open-source bounty model is one such promising business model.

It may be useful for any collaborative project outside IT, that involves only desk work. You may apply it to overcome the  general limitations of the desk-job-based economy. It will give rise to a new kind of economy where individuals have more freedom and opportunities to earn.

# How it works (an overview)

The process solves 5 pain areas of desk-job industries especially IT, in novel ways:  
1. It defines a general-purpose, accurate and transparent measure of intellectual effort. This is very important for fairness and trust among all. You use it instead of estimates, as the measure by which to reward crowd members and charge the customer. The CollaboRate tool helps to make intellectual effort measurable.  
2. The process reduces the risks of incorrect or  incomplete work for the customer. It does so by sharing the financial risks with the erring crowd members via a penalty system. Most people will still continue to earn well. So they will agree to the risk sharing process.  
3. The process allows people to work with no technical, codebase and requirements knowledge. It also ensures that the work  per crowd member is very small and thus very easy. The CollaboRate  tool facilitates performing the small work. This allows more inclusive participation and reduces project risk.    
4. The process and tool divide the project work such that you can use the most number of  crowd members.  Efforts needed from the  project governing body are very small.    
5. It ensures superior intellectual property security. Security increases with crowd size!  

#Detailed benefits for employees and their organizations
- Variable income in accurate proportion to contributions of the employee.   
- No need for subjective appraisals done by humans. This ends a huge source of workplace conflict and injustice.  
- Since project security and complexity are no longer issues:
  - No need to call employees to an office and keep an eye on them. So employees can work from home.
  - Employees can work for multiple projects and organizations at the same time with security concerns from any organization.

# Detailed benefits for customers
  - Faster time to completion
  - Reduced financial risk
  - Superior/impeccable code, documentation and design quality

# Who's using it?
As of now the project is in the process of releasing the first version of the tool, as well as the documentation for the process and philosophy needed to utilize the tool effectively.

# Getting started
First please read the philosophy and process recommended to be followed while using the tool. The documentation is available [here](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/wiki).

# How to use the tool?
1. This software is intended to be used along with a conventional issue/bug tracking system, and by forming a team of a few individuals who are entrusted with project governance, architecting, customer interaction and crowd interaction. Though the tool attempts to provide instructions about the process to follow, it is probably better to go through the documentation first (that covers the philosophy and the overall process). This will help to better understand where and why the tool is used in the overall recommended process.
2. The tool is a 'wizard' i.e. it is a very simple piece of software that guides a member of the crowd to do the smallest (easiest) possible intellectual/software work.
3. To use the tool, just [download](https://github.com/sohrabsaran/CollaboRate/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository. There is no other install or build step needed. Simply open CollaboRate.html in your web browser, preferably FireFox and answer the questions/follow the instructions shown by the wizard.
