							<b>Overview</b><br>
							This tool is the 'CollaboRate 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure">Work Breakdown</a> 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)">Wizard</a>'. It is used by online workers to do their work.
							<br><br>
							This tool is part of the open source project '<a href="https://github.com/CollaboRateMgmt/CollaboRate">CollaboRate</a>'.
							One of the main goals of this project is to create opportunities for anyone to earn online by doing small, easy, fun, and 
							socially useful intellectual tasks.	The work done is used to develop, maintain and test software apps.
						</div>
						<div id="tabpane-benefits" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>Benefits</b><br>
							This tool is part of a new way of software development, that has the following benefits:
							<ul>
								<li>Allows people to earn money by doing online work, in an enjoyable, flexible and socially useful way.</li>
								<li>Provides people ample time to learn the skills and industry knowledge needed to do the work.</li>
								<li>
									It provides a very accurate way to measure people's work.  
									This in turn allows people to be paid in a very fair manner.
								</li>
								<li>								
									Better quality code is created that is very simple and very well documented.
								</li>
								<li>
									This way of software development allows a very large number of people to work on the same project at the 
									same time. So it is very fast when the number of people working on the project are very large in number.
								</li>								
								<li>
									It reduces financial risks for those who need software to be developed. 
									This is done by sharing the risk in a fair and small way with all people, including those working on the project. 
									The risk per person becomes smaller, when there are more workers on the project.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
						</div>
						<div id="tabpane-skillsneeded" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>Skills Needed by Online Workers</b><br>
							As a 'crowd member' (one of the online workers) you must have the following skills:
							<ul>								
								<li>Able to read and write English. As of now, this tool is limited to the English language.</li>
								<li>Willing to learn a small amount of any additional publicly available information needed to work on the small task. 
								(You will be given ample time to learn and complete the task.)</li>
								<li>
									A basic understanding of how a software app works and some related terms, at the level taught to 8-year-olds in school. 
									This is specified as follows:
									<ul>
										<li>
											An app is a set of instructions written by people, that tell a computer how to do a particular task. 
											Examples of apps are Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, apps installed on smartphones, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											An app accepts various types of inputs (information).
											Inputs may be provided by:
											<ul>
												<li>a person (user of the app) via electronic machines called 'input devices'. Examples of such input devices are keyboard, mouse, touchscreen etc.</li> 
												<li>an alarm set on the computer's clock</li>
												<li>some other app</li>
												<li>other input devices that can automatically provide input whether the user is present or not. For example, microphone, camera etc.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											The app then 'processes' these inputs. 
											This means that the app does a list of things called 'steps' on these inputs. 
											The app may behave differently, based on different types of inputs provided to it.
										</li>
										<li>Some of these steps may create part of the results that we expect to see or hear from the computer (the output).</li>
										<li>Other steps may update the data (information) remembered by the app.
										</li>
										<li>Some other steps may check the information remembered by the app, or the inputs given 
											to the app and then do further steps differently depending on the information/inputs.
										</li>
										<li>
											Yet some other steps may cause a message to be sent to another app. 
											The two apps may be connected together over the internet.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div id="tabpane-theprocess" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>The Process</b><br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Open source projects or commercial groups called 'Crowdsourcing vendors' advertise online work opportunities to the public.
									We term these potential workers as 'crowd members'.
								</li>
								<li>The crowd members register on the website of the crowdsourding vendor and then submit a request for work.
								</li>
								<li>The crowdsourcing vendor assigns some text to the crowd member that does not exceed 2000 characters. 
									This text is a description of a part of the software app being developed . 
									It is also known as a task or microtask. Once this text is assigned, the crowd member will receive a link to this
									text via email, or in the appropriate section of the vendor's website that is visible once the member has logged in.
								</li>
								<li>The crowd member will click on the link. 
								This tool will then open up in the web browser of the crowd member, with the assigned description also loaded.</li> 
								<li>This tool asks the member a series of questions about the description that was given to the member. 
									For most of these questions, the member has to choose the right answer from a list of possible answers. 
									Based on the previous choice made by the member, the tool will decide the next question to ask.
								</li> 
								<li>The tool captures the answers provided by the member and submits them to the website of the crowdsourcing vendor.</li>
								<li>Depending on the agreements between the crowdsourcing vendor and the crowd members, the crowd members will get 
									paid based on the number of micro-tasks done correctly and in time. 
								</li>
								<li>
									The crowdsourcing vendor may also ask for a tiny amount of money as a security deposit from the crowd member. 										 
									If delays or errors caused by the crowd member cause a loss that is more than what can be deducted from the 
									payment amount per microtask, a part of this deposit may be used up.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>		
						<div id="tabpane-howitworks" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>How It Works</b><br>
							Note: It is not necessary for the crowd members to understand the below in order for them to do their work.<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									By answering the series of questions asked by the tool, you break down (divide) the partial description of the app, 
									into one or two more such partial descriptions of the app. Let's call the broken-down descriptions 'sub-descriptions'.
								</li>
								<li>
									Assume that the crowd member answers the questions asked by this tool correctly and as instructed. In that case,  
									these sub-descriptions along with the answers to the objective-type questions, 
									will usually contain neither more nor less scope and information than the original description.
								</li>
								<li>
									In some cases, the descriptions will become more detailed.
									In some other cases, a small amount of new information might need to be introduced, based on publicly available 
									information about the industry area of the application that is being developed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Whether or not more elaboration of the problem has happened or more information has been added, each sub-description
									must contain all the needed information, such that it is not needed to refer to the parent description in order to
									understand the sub-description. Each sub-description must also remove that part of the parent description that is 
									not of relevance to it.
								</li>
								<li>
									Due to the above rules for the sub-descriptions, these sub-descriptions can be further provided to any other crowd 
									members to break down, and so on, until it is not possible to break the sub-descriptions down any further.
								</li>
								<li>
									The answers to some of the objective-type questions determine one of the processing steps done by the app. 
									In this way, crowd members help to create all the processing steps (source code) of the app!
								</li>
								<li>
									The 'binary' work breakdown way of working allows us to very accurately measure work done by the crowd members.
									The current assumption is that the average effort needed to break down a task is almost the same, 
									especially given that there is a limit imposed on the maximum number of characters of task's text.
									So we can simply measure of the contributions of the crowd members by counting the number of microtasks that each
									crowd member has broken down.<br>
									Even if it is found that different tasks need different amounts of effort later on, we can refine this system of 
									work measurement slightly. The basic system of work measurement seems likely to remain the same. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Creating multiple subtasks helps to allow multiple crowd members to work on the same project in parallel, 
									so that the project gets over quickly when a large number of crowd members are available. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Creating multiple subtasks provides security for those projects that need it. 
									Crowdsourcing vendors can ensure that each crowd member gets to work on only a small part of the project.
									This way, no single crowd member knows the entire project design. If the project requirements are themselves 
									confidential, then the crowdsourcing vendor can itself do the work breakdown up to some level and then 
									crowdsource the rest of the work.
								</li>							
								<li>
									To ensure the quality of the work being done by the crowd and to troubleshoot (find the cause of errors), 
									a number of techniques can be used by the crowdsourcing vendor. These must include:
									<ul>
										<li>manual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">acceptance testing</a> - performed by the crowdsourcing vendor and/or the end customer</li>							
										<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a> - used to troubleshoot that which work breakdown done by the crowd, is incorrect.</li>
										<li>automation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">regression testing</a> - used to reduce the manual testing efforts and errors. Both acceptance testing and unit testing can be automated.</li> 
									</ul>
									In additional to the above mandatory testing, crowdsourcing vendors may also ensure quality by the asking the crowd 
									members to review each others' work (at the cost of some small loss of security). Finally the crowdsourcing vendors may use a 
									variety of Natural Langauge Processing and other AI techniques to check the the crowd members have done the work correctly. 
									Some such validations may be offered for free as a part of this tool.

							<b>Instructions for Crowdsourcing Vendors</b><br>
							This tool is part of the open source (MIT licensed) <a href="https://github.com/CollaboRateMgmt/CollaboRate">CollaboRate</a> project. 
							This tool is open sourced to serve as a standard
							interface for Crowd Members to use to perform the binary work breakdown, irrespective of the crowdsourcing vendor that 
							hosts this tool. You can include this tool like an html widget into your html page as follows:<br><br>
							Put the following in the &lt;head&gt; section of your html page:<br>							
							&lt;script src=&quot;https://collaboratemgmt.github.io/CollaboRate/collaborate_single_widget.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
							<br><br>
							Put the following in the &lt;body&gt; section of your html page:<br><br>							
							&lt;script&gt;
							loadwidget(&quot;https://collaboratemgmt.github.io/CollaboRate/CollaboRateV2.html&quot;)
							&lt;/script&gt;
							<br><br>
							Once the following are identified:
							<ul>
								<li>Subtask 1 of the task</li>
								<li>Subtask 2 of the task</li>
								<li>Logic that connects the 2 subtasks</li>
							</ul>
							...you need to create entries for each of the above in your db, via calling the appropriate js functions from your copy of this tool. 
							For each of these three data values, the problem statement that was broken down using this tool is called the 'parent. 
							The relation to the parent id is also stored with each new data value. Here's sample json that will be sent to your url:
							<br>
							<br>
							You will further validate
							the input provided by the crowd member either manually or programmatically. You will use the inputs provided by the crowd members  to 
							generate the documentation and source code of the app.
