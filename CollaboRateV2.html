					Welcome to the next version of the CollaboRate work breakdown wizard<br><br>
					
					<b>Instructions for Crowd Members</b><br>
					A crowdsourcing vendor or an open source project has assigned you a task. The task can either be the description of an entire software 
					app, or may describe part of the app. You have been asked to use this tool to break down the assigned task.<br>
					This tool will guide you to break down (divide) your assigned task into a maximum of two subtasks. 
					This tool is mainly a 'wizard' or guidance program. It presents you a series of questions and also presents you some answers to choose from in order
					to reply to some of the questions. Based on the choices you make and information you provide, the tool then allows you to submit this work that you 
					have done, back to the team that gave your this task.<br>
					These subtasks will if needed, be further broken down by the crowd members.<br><br> 
					Please note that you must not solve the assigned task completely!<br>
					All you must do is create its subtasks. These subtasks when considered together, must contain neither any more or less scope 
					and information than the assigned task, except that these subtasks might further elaborate design or processing details that were 
					implied by the parent task. The logic that connects the subtasks to each other is specified by you with the help of this tool. This
					logic is used to create the processing steps done by the app on the input provided to it, to produce the expected output. In this way,
					crowd members help to create all the processing steps (source code) of the app!
					<br>
					The 'binary' work breakdown way of working allows us to more accurately measure work done by the crowd members. 
					The work that you are doing to break down the assigned task is called 'doing a microtask'. Your contribution to the project is 
					rated as being proportional to the number of microtasks you perform. It is assumed that the average effort needed to break down a task
					is almost the same, especially given that there is a limit imposed on the maximum number of characters that a task can contain.
					Creating multiple subtasks also helps to allow multiple crowd members to work on the same project in parallel, so that the project gets over quickly when a large number of crowd members are available.
					
					<br><br>
					<b>Instructions for Crowdsourcing Vendors</b><br>
					Once the following are identified:
					<ul>
						<li>Subtask 1 of the task</li>
						<li>Subtask 2 of the task</li>
						<li>Logic that connects the 2 subtask</li>
					</ul>
					...you need to create 3 data nodes for each of the above in your db, via calling the appropriate js functions from your copy of this tool. 
					For each of these three nodes, the problem statement that was broken down using this tool is the parent node. You will further validate
					the input provided by the crowd member either manually or programmatically. You will use the inputs provided by the crowd members  to 
					generate the documentation and source code of the app.

				An app accepts various inputs (information). Inputs may be provided by a human (user) or some timer or even by some other app.
				The application produces some outputs after processing (doing some mathematical or logical steps on) these inputs. 
				A particular type of input-process-output is called an 'interaction'.<br>
				<br>
					What kind of problem statement is this task?

							<h2>App Interactions</h2>
							The assigned task describes one or more types of application interactions.<br><br>
							Does the assigned task describe more than one type of application interaction?<br>
							TODO: Create tabs for 'more than one type of interaction' and 'only one type of interaction'. Latter is a 'unit use case'.

						<div id="tabpane-step" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
							<h2>Processing Step</h2>
							The assigned task describes a step done by the application to process some input given to it. This step may be the entire
							processing involved for the specified input, or it may be a sub-step.
							<br>
							<br>
							TODO: This is nothing but a function definition. Ask the questions over here related to breakdown of the function.
