							Welcome to the the CollaboRate
							<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure">work breakdown</a> 
							<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)">wizard</a> v2.0.
							This tool is part of the Open Source CollaboRate project.<br>
							One of the main goals of this project is to create opportunities to earn online by doing small, easy, fun, and 
							socially useful intellectual tasks.<br>
							This intellectual work done is used to develop, maintain and test software apps.<br>
							The information below should be enough to get you started with the tool and process.<br> 
							For more information, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CollaboRateMgmt/CollaboRate">project website</a>.<br><br>

						<div id="tabpane-benefits" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>Benefits</b><br><br>
							This tool is part of a new way of software development, that has the following benefits:
							<ul>
								<li>It allows for greater employment opportunities in the field of software development. This is because it 
									allows people to develop software even if they do not have the skills and knowledge usually associated with
									software development jobs.
								</li>
								<li>Allows people to earn good amounts of income online, in an enjoyable, flexible and socially useful way.</li>
								<li>
									It provides a very accurate way to decide that who has contributed how much to the project. 
									This in turn allows the people who worked on the project to be paid in a very fair manner.									
								</li>
								<li>								
									Much better quality code is created.
								</li>
								<li>
									This way of software development allows a very large number of people to work on the same project at the 
									same time. So it is very fast when the number of people working on the project are very large in number.
								</li>								
								<li>
									It reduces financial risks for those who need software to be developed. 
									This is done by sharing the risk in a fair and small way with all stakeholders. The risk per person becomes 
									smaller when the number of people working on the project are very large in number.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
						</div>
						<div id="tabpane-skillsneeded" class="tab-pane fade">
							
							As a crowd member, you must have the following skills:
							<ul>								
								<li>Able to read and write English clearly and correctly. As of now, this tool is limited to the English language.</li>
								<li>Willing to learn a small amount of any additional publicly available information needed to work on the small task. </li>
								<li>
									A basic understanding of how a software app works and some related terms, at the level taught to 8-year-olds in school. 
									This can be summarized as follows:
									<ul>
										<li>
											An app is set of instructions written by people, that tell the computer how to do a particular task. 
											Examples of apps are Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, apps installed on smartphones, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											An app accepts various inputs (information) for example: text, video, pictures or sound. 
											Inputs may be provided by:
											<ul>
												<li>a person (user of the app)</li> 
												<li>an alarm set on the computer's internal clock</li>
												<li>some other app</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											The app then does processing (a list of logic and/or maths steps) on these inputs. 
										</li>
										<li>Some processing steps create part of the output.</li>
										<li>Some processing steps update to the data stored by the app. 
											The app may store data on hard disks or in case of mobile apps, 
											on the 'permanent memory' of the smartphone.
										</li>											
										<li>
											Like the input to an app, the output produced by an app is also information that may be in various forms.
										</li>
										<li>A particular type of input-process-output is called an 'interaction'.</li>
									</li>										
								</ul>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div id="tabpane-theprocess" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>The Process</b><br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Open source projects or commercial groups called 'Crowdsourcing vendors' advertize online work opportunities to the public.
									We term these potential workers as 'crowd members'.
								</li>
								<li>The crowd members respond to these ads by requesting for work.
								</li>
								<li>Descriptions of parts of the software app being developed will be shared with the crowd members, along with a link to this tool.
								The description given to the user is also known as a task or microtask. 
								</li>
								<li>Users will click on the link provided and this tool will open up in their web browsers.</li> 
								<li>This tool asks the user a series of questions about the description that was given to the user. 
								For most of these questions, the user has to choose the right answer from a list of possible answers. 
								Based on your previous choice, the tool will decide the next question to ask.
								</li> 
								<li>The tool captures the answers provided by the user and submits them online to the website of the crowdsourcing vendor.</li>
								<li>Depending on the agreements between the crowdsourcing vendor and the crowd members, the crowd members will get 
								paid based on the number of micro-tasks done correctly and in time.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>		
						<div id="tabpane-howitworks" class="tab-pane fade">
							<b>How It Works</b><br>
							<ul>
							<li>
							By answering the series of questions asked by the tool, you break down (divide) the partial description of the app, 
							into one or two more such partial descriptions of the app. Let's call the broken-down descriptions 'sub-descriptions'.
							</li>
							<li>
							Assume that the crowd member answers the questions asked by this tool correctly and as instructed. In that case,  
							these sub-descriptions along with the answers to the objective-type questions, 
							will contain neither any more or less scope and information than the original description.<br> 
							In some cases the descriptions might need to be slighly more elaborated.
							Or a small amount of new information might need to be introduced, based on publicly available information about the 
							industry area of the application that is being developed.<br>
							Whether or not more elaboration of the problem has happened or more information has been added, each sub-description
							must contain all the needed information, such that it is not needed to refer to the parent description in order to
							understand the sub-description. Each sub-description must also remove that part of the parent description that is 
							not of relevance to it.<br>
							The sub-descriptions can then be further provided to crowd members to break down, and so on.
							</li>
							<li>
							The answers to some of the objective-type questions determine one of the processing steps done by the app. 
							In this way, crowd members help to create all the processing steps (source code) of the app!
							</li>
							<li>
							The 'binary' work breakdown way of working allows us to very accurately measure work done by the crowd members.
							The current assumption is that the average effort needed to break down a task is almost the same, 
							especially given that there is a limit imposed on the maximum number of characters of task's text.
							So we can simply measure of the contributions of the crowd members by counting the number of microtasks that each
							crowd member has broken down.<br>
							Even if it is found that different tasks need different amounts of effort later on, we can refine this system of 
							work measurement slightly. The basic system of work measurement seems likely to remain the same. 
							</li>
							<li>
							Creating multiple subtasks also helps to allow multiple crowd members to work on the same project in parallel, 
							so that the project gets over quickly when a large number of crowd members are available.
							</li>

							<b>Instructions for Crowdsourcing Vendors</b><br>
							This tool is part of the open source (MIT licensed) CollaboRate project. This tool is open sourced to serve as a standard
							interface for Crowd Members to use to perform the binary work breakdown, irrespective of the crowdsourcing vendor that 
							hosts this tool.<br>
							Once the following are identified:
							<ul>
								<li>Subtask 1 of the task</li>
								<li>Subtask 2 of the task</li>
								<li>Logic that connects the 2 subtask</li>
							</ul>
							...you need to create 3 data nodes for each of the above in your db, via calling the appropriate js functions from your copy of this tool. 
							For each of these three nodes, the problem statement that was broken down using this tool is the parent node. You will further validate
							the input provided by the crowd member either manually or programmatically. You will use the inputs provided by the crowd members  to 
							generate the documentation and source code of the app.
