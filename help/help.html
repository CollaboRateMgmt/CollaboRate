		<!--<b>Overview</b><br>-->
		This tool is the 'CollaboRate
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure">Work Breakdown</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)">Wizard</a>'.
		You use this tool to do online work that involves the skills of English, Logic, and a small study of information
		available online.
		<br><br>
		This tool is part of the open source project '<a href="https://github.com/CollaboRateMgmt/CollaboRate">CollaboRate</a>'.
		One of the main goals of this project is to create opportunities for anyone to earn online by doing small, easy,
		fun, and
		socially useful intellectual tasks. The work done is used to develop, maintain and test software apps.
	</div>
	<div id="tabpane-benefits" class="tab-pane fade">
		<!--<b>Benefits</b><br>-->
		This is a new way of software development, that has the following benefits:
		<ul>
			<li>Enables earning by doing socially useful online work, in an enjoyable, flexible way.</li>
			<li>Provides time to learn the skills and industry knowledge needed to do the work.</li>
			<li>
				Measures people's work accurately, and gives fair pay.
			</li>
			<li>
				Creates quality code.
			</li>
			<li>
				Allows a very large number of people to work on the same project at the
				same time. This allows fast project completion.
			</li>
			<li>
				It reduces financial risks for those who need software to be developed.
				Risk is shared in a fair and small way with all people, including those working on the project.
				The risk per person becomes smaller, when there are more workers on the project.

		<!--<b>Skills Needed by Online Workers</b><br>-->
		As a 'crowd member' (one of the online workers) you must have the following skills:
		<ul>
			<li>Able to read and write English. As of now, this tool is limited to the English language.</li>
			<li>Willing to learn a small amount of any additional publicly available information needed to work on the small
				task.
				(You will be given ample time to learn and complete the task.)</li>
			<li>
				A basic understanding of how a software app works and some related terms, at the level taught to 8-year-olds in
				school.
				This is specified as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>
						An app is a set of instructions written by people, that tell a computer how to do a particular task.
						Examples of apps are Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, apps installed on smartphones, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						An app accepts various types of inputs (information).
						Inputs may be provided by:
						<ul>
							<li>a person (user of the app) via electronic machines called 'input devices'. Examples of such input
								devices are keyboard, mouse, touchscreen etc.</li>
							<li>an alarm set on the computer's clock</li>
							<li>some other app</li>
							<li>other input devices that can automatically provide input whether the user is present or not. For
								example, microphone, camera etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The app then 'processes' these inputs.
						This means that the app does a list of things called 'steps' on these inputs.
						The app may behave differently, based on different types of inputs provided to it.
					</li>
					<li>Some of these steps may create part of the results that we expect to see or hear from the computer (the
						output).</li>
					<li>Other steps may update the data (information) remembered by the app.
					</li>
					<li>Some other steps may check the information remembered by the app, or the inputs given
						to the app and then do further steps differently depending on the information/inputs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Yet some other steps may cause a message to be sent to another app.
						The two apps may be connected together over the internet.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<div id="tabpane-theprocess" class="tab-pane fade">
		<!--<b>The Process</b><br><br>-->
		<ul>
			<li>Open source projects or commercial groups called 'Crowdsourcing vendors' advertise online work opportunities
				to the public.
				We term these potential workers as 'crowd members'.
			</li>
			<li>The crowd members register on the website of the crowdsourding vendor and then submit a request for work.
			</li>
			<li>The crowdsourcing vendor assigns some text to the crowd member that does not exceed 2000 characters.
				This text is a description of a part of the software app being developed .
				It is also known as a task or microtask. Once this text is assigned, the crowd member will receive a link to
				this
				text via email, or in the appropriate section of the vendor's website that is visible once the member has
				logged in.
			</li>
			<li>The crowd member will click on the link.
				This tool will then open up in the web browser of the crowd member, with the assigned description also loaded.</li>
			<li>This tool asks the member a series of questions about the description that was given to the member.
				For most of these questions, the member has to choose the right answer from a list of possible answers.
				Based on the previous choice made by the member, the tool will decide the next question to ask.
			</li>
			<li>The tool captures the answers provided by the member and submits them to the website of the crowdsourcing
				vendor.</li>
			<li>Depending on the agreements between the crowdsourcing vendor and the crowd members, the crowd members will
				get
				paid based on the number of micro-tasks done correctly and in time.
			</li>
			<li>
				The crowdsourcing vendor may also ask for a tiny amount of money as a security deposit from the crowd member.
				If delays or errors caused by the crowd member cause a loss that is more than what can be deducted from the
				payment amount per microtask, a part of this deposit may be used up.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<b>How It Works</b><br>
		Note: It is not necessary for the crowd members to understand the below in order for them to do their work.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				How is Simplicity Achieved:<br>
				By answering the series of questions asked by the tool, you break down (divide) the description of the old app,
				into descriptions of new apps. This is a <b>small task</b> compared to writing the entire code of the old app.
				You are also <b>not doing any coding</b>; you are just solving problems in English Comprehension and Logic and
				may be reading up a small amount of information on the Internet.
			</li>
			<li>
				How can a large number of people work on the same app:<br>
				As per the instructions given, the description of the new apps must contain all the needed information, such
				that it is not
				needed to refer to the description of the old app in order to understand the new app.
				The description of the new app must also remove that part of the description of the old app that is not of
				relevance
				to the new app.
				So <b>crowd members do not need to read the description of the old app</b> in order to understand the
				description of the new apps.
			</li>
			<li>
				How are lines of code generated:<br>
				Let's for the moment assume that the crowd member answers the questfions asked by this tool correctly and as
				instructed.
				In that case,
				the information represented by the combined descriptions of the new apps and the answers to the objective-type
				questions,
				should contain the same scope as the description of the old app. The answers to the objective-type questions
				are used to
				<b>create a line of the code</b> of the old app, that uses the new apps.
			</li>
			<li>
				How are thousands of lines of code and large amounts of needed knowledge captured:<br>
				As the app description breakdown continues, the descriptions of the new apps will talk about <b>details</b>
				that were
				implied in the scope of the old apps.
				Also, a small amount of <b>new information</b> might need to be introduced in the descriptions of the new apps,
				based on <b>publicly available information</b> about the industry area of the app.
			</li>
			<li>
				How are project costs and payments to the crowd members accurately determined:<br>
				The technique of breaking the description of an old app into descriptions of least possible number of new apps,
				<b>allows accurate measurement of work. As opposed to counting lines of code, this technique
					counts the number of logic steps. The crowdsourcing vendor is also responsible to reduce repetition in logic
					steps.</b>
				The current assumption is that the average effort needed to break down an app is almost the same,
				especially given that there is a limit imposed on the maximum number of characters of the app's description.
				So we can simply measure of the contributions of the crowd members by counting the number of app descriptions
				that each
				crowd member has broken down.<br>
				Even if it is found that different app descriptions need different amounts of effort later on, we can refine
				this system of
				work measurement, to (say) also consider the number of characters in the description of the old app, as well
				the number of
				new apps created during the breakdown of the old app.
				The basic system of work measurement seems likely to remain the same.
			</li>
			<li>
				How is this process faster:<br>
				Creating multiple new apps helps to allow multiple crowd members to work on the same project in parallel,
				so that the <b>project gets over quickly</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				How is this process more secure and can allow no offices and permanent work-from-home:<br>
				Creating multiple new apps provides <b>security</b> for those projects that need it.
				Crowdsourcing vendors can ensure that each crowd member gets to work on only a small part of the project.
				This way, no single crowd member knows the entire project design. If the project requirements are themselves
				confidential, then the crowdsourcing vendor can itself do the work breakdown up to some level and then
				crowdsource the rest of the work.
			</li>
			<li>
				How is the app tested:<br>
				To ensure the quality of the work being done by the crowd and to troubleshoot (find the cause of errors),
				a number of techniques can be used by the crowdsourcing vendor. These must include:
				<ul>
					<li>manual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">acceptance testing</a> - performed by
						the crowdsourcing vendor and/or the end customer</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a> - used to troubleshoot that which
						work breakdown done by the crowd, is incorrect.</li>
					<li>automation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">regression testing</a> - used to
						reduce the manual testing efforts and errors. Both acceptance testing and unit testing can be automated.</li>
				</ul>
				In additional to the above mandatory testing, crowdsourcing vendors may also ensure quality by the asking the
				crowd
				members to review each others' work (at the cost of some small loss of security). Finally the crowdsourcing
				vendors may use a
				variety of Natural Langauge Processing and other AI techniques to check the the crowd members have done the
				work correctly.
				Some such validations may be offered for free as a part of this tool.

		<b>Instructions for Crowdsourcing Vendors</b><br>
		This tool is part of the open source (MIT licensed) <a href="https://github.com/CollaboRateMgmt/CollaboRate">CollaboRate</a>
		project.
		This tool is open sourced to serve as a standard
		interface for Crowd Members to use to perform the binary work breakdown, irrespective of the crowdsourcing vendor
		that
		hosts this tool. You can include this tool like an html widget into your html page as follows:<br><br>
		Put the following in the &lt;head&gt; section of your html page:<br>
		&lt;script
		src=&quot;https://collaboratemgmt.github.io/CollaboRate/collaborate_single_widget.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
		<br><br>
		Put the following in the &lt;body&gt; section of your html page:<br><br>
		&lt;script&gt;
		loadwidget(&quot;https://collaboratemgmt.github.io/CollaboRate/CollaboRateV2.html&quot;)
		&lt;/script&gt;
		<br><br>
		Once the following are identified:
		<ul>
			<li>Subtask 1 of the task</li>
			<li>Subtask 2 of the task</li>
			<li>Logic that connects the 2 subtasks</li>
		</ul>
		...you need to create entries for each of the above in your db, via calling the appropriate js functions from
		your copy of this tool.
		For each of these three data values, the problem statement that was broken down using this tool is called the
		'parent.
		The relation to the parent id is also stored with each new data value. Here's sample json that will be sent to
		your url:
		<br>
		<br>
		You will further validate
		the input provided by the crowd member either manually or programmatically. You will use the inputs provided by
		the crowd members to
		generate the documentation and source code of the app.
